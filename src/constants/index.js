    text: "Hey there! I'm KnightOwl, a web developer, designer, and graphic artist passionate about bringing creative visions to life online. My journey into code and design began with curiosity and a whole lot of self-driven exploration—think late nights, countless tutorials, and an unstoppable drive to learn. This independent learning style has shaped my diverse skill set, sharpened my problem-solving abilities, and fueled my love for tackling new challenges. I’m always eager to grow, stay ahead of trends, and push creative boundaries. Whether you need a sleek website, a standout logo, or a full brand refresh, let’s collaborate and create something amazing!",
